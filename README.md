**Hi-LO-Other**

You are making a game!

**Game Play:**

Your program should output two random values between 1-13 (inclusively).

Your program should then ask the user to predict whether a third random value (also between 1-13) will be one of three options….

1) Higher than both numbers

2) Lower than both numbers

3) Other (this would mean it’s in-between both numbers or the same as one (or both) of the numbers)

Generate a third random number and see if their prediction is correct.

The game should be in a loop so that they automatically get to keep playing the game. 

  

**Possible Extensions** for Level 4 Consideration (not equally weighted)

- When the user is entering their prediction, include an option to let them quit the game

- Improved visual output

- Track how many times the user is correct and incorrect with their predictions 

- Anything else that improves the game
